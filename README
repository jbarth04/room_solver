Problem statement:

    Given n people trying to sort out room arrangements for n rooms, this 
    program solves possible room combination given the preferences from
    each user.  If no room combinations are possible to satisfy "yes" 
    preferences to each person, this program prints "no solution" to 
    standard output.

Example input: 

    First line of input is the number of people (which is also equal to 
    the number of rooms).
    The following n lines of input are the names of n people, each with 
    n preferences.  Preferences are indicated by either Y (yes) or N (no)
    for each room.
